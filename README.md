## 💻 How It Works

### 1. **HTML (Structure)**
- Builds the calculator layout inside a `<div>` with an input field (`#display`) for showing results.  
- Each button (`<button>`) triggers a JavaScript function when clicked.

### 2. **CSS (Design)**
- Dark theme with soft red glow and hover animations.  
- Rounded corners, smooth transitions, and shadows for a glowing 3D feel.  
- Buttons enlarge slightly on hover for better interactivity.

### 3. **JavaScript (Functionality)**
The main logic includes:

```js
// Selects the display element
const display = document.getElementById("display");

// Adds each clicked number or symbol to the display
function buttonEachNumber(input) {
    display.value += input;
}

// Clears the display
function clearDisplay() {
    display.value = "";
    display.style.color = "white";
}

// Calculates and shows the result
function calculate() {
    try {
        display.value = eval(display.value); // Evaluates the expression
    } catch (error) {
        display.value = "ERROR";
        display.style.color = "red"; // Changes color for error
    }
}



🪄 Future Improvements

Add keyboard input support.

Include %, √, and memory (M+, M-, MR) buttons.

Display calculation history.

Add sound or vibration feedback for clicks.
